## About

The repository contains a collection of data and results, that is based on MusiCAU's output, i.e. its [tools](https://github.com/cau-mi/musicau-demo) and/or the [transcriptions](https://github.com/Chorale-Corpus). This includes articles, presentations, visualizations and the database with an overview of all *Choralb√ºcher* that have been or will be transcribed for MusiCAU. The aim of this repository is therefore to communicate the findings gained during the development and first uses of MusiCAU.

## Credits

MusiCAU was developed at the Musicological Institute at Kiel University. For further information on the people involved see CONTRIBUTORS.
The transcriptions were created and revised between January 2021 and September 2023.
